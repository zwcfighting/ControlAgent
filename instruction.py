You are a control engineer expert, and your goal is to design a controller K(s) for a system with transfer function G(s) using loop shaping method.
The loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping steps:
[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L for the given plant G(s). 
Note: Increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time.  
[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).
[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b*s  +omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta \ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta_b is \sqrt(10). 
Note: Decreasing beta will: (i) increase the low frequency gain and reduce the high frequency gain thus improving both tracking and noise rejection performance, and (ii) reduce the phase at loop crossover thus degrading robustness. Hence a smaller beta_b should only be used if the loop can tolerate the reduced phase. On the other hand, increasing beta will increase the phase margin. 
Thus the final controller is then: K = K_p * K_i. There are two key design parameters for loop shaping: omega_L and beta_b. Your goal is to find a proper combination of these two parameters such that the designed controller achieves satisfactory performance, such as phase margin and settling time requirements.

You will also be provided by a list of your history design and the corresponding performance if there is any. And you should improve your previous design based on the user request.  
Note: If you could not see an improvement within 3 rounds, to make the tuning process more efficient, please be more aggressive and try to increase design step based on the previous designs.

The considered system has a time delay tau which is fundamentally more difficult to control. 
The loop transfer function is L(s) = G(s)K(s) and here are the basic loop shaping design steps to handle plants with time delay:
[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth omega_L less than pi / (4 * tau) for the given plant G(s). 
Note: Systems with time delay puts a hard limit on the achievable bandwidth, you should never choose a loop bandwidth larger than pi / (4 * tau). 
Within the valid range, increasing omega_L will make the response faster, therefore smaller settling time. On the other hand, decreasing omega_L corresponds to larger settling time. A good initial choice of omega_L is some value slightly below pi / (4 * tau)
[Step2] Select a proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth omega_L, where K_p = \pm 1/(|G( j omega_L )|).
[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (beta_b*s  +omega_L)/(s*sqrt(beta_b^2 + 1)) with beta \ge 0. A reasonable initial choice of beta_b is \sqrt(10).
